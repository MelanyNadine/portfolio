      There have been debates about the cosmological constant since it was first proposed in 1917 as a
      parameter that, when inserted into the original gravitational field equation, would have as one of the
      solutions what could be interpreted as proof that the universe remains static. However, in 1931, when
      Hubble (for whom the most famous telescope in the field was named) discovered the first glimpses of
      what appeared to be an expanding universe, Einstein didn’t take long to recognize his apparent error
      and called it "the biggest mistake of his life" (quoted in Gamow, 1970), and since then, the core of the
      debate has been the existence or not of this constant, given that following Hubble's discovery, and until
      1998, astronomers attributed to the constant a value of zero. What happened in 1998 that reignited the
      debate about the cosmological constant, and for which research continues to this day? Well, in 1998 the
      Supernova cosmology project reported the first evidence for a positive, low-density cosmological
      constant that will "expand the universe forever" [Cosmology from Type la Spernovae, 1998, arXiv].
      <br>
      In simpler terms, Einstein claimed, by introducing the cosmological constant (with a value of 0), that
      the universe remains static; he even claimed that the shape of the universe would be a sphere whose
      mass was determined by an equation that for the sake of simplicity is not intended to be shown here.
      All this began after completing his formulations of general relativity in 1915-1916; Einstein, in 1917,
      tried to apply his new theory to the entire universe. For this purpose, he started from the hypothesis that
      the universe was static; however, no static solution to his original equations (other than Newtonian
      gravitation) could be found, so he modified them by adding a new term involving a parameter Λ; the
      cosmological constant [Steven Weinberg, 1989], was born.
      <br>
      Up to the time when the first glimpses of an expanding universe were discovered (1931, as previously
      mentioned) there was the concept that the cosmological constant, its very existence, must be
      intrinsically related to a static universe; in other words, and following the logic of the premises, the
      contradiction of a static universe implied at that time the contradiction of the existence of the
      cosmological constant. This could be seen in the reaction of the physics community and even of
      Einstein himself to the new discovery, denying the cosmological constant and attributing its conception
      to an error, respectively. By the time Steven Weinberg, a respected scientist who was honored after his
      death in 2021, wrote his essay entitled "The Problem of the Cosmological Constant" and as mentioned
      therein, the physics community was beginning to have doubts about the depreciation of the constant; in
      his words at the time: "Physics is going through a crisis".
      <br>
      That is, by the time the Supernova cosmology project had published its results (1998), the existence of
      the cosmological constant was already being discussed in the scientific community, but this time, with
      a value different from zero; already in 1995 Lawrence Krauss and Michael Turner published an article
      in Springer, entitled "The cosmological constant is back". In it they argued that a series of observations
      would suggest that the universe has a non-zero cosmological constant. It can be inferred then that by
      the time the Supernova cosmology project had published the results, they were already anticipated by
      the physics community, so this discovery would have only confirmed something that had been
      suspected since the late 1980s.
      <br>
      Despite the fact that this discovery has been practically two decades in the making, it is a "novelty" for
      many, even in areas where there are many supporters of science and philosophy; Many are unaware
      that the universe is expanding, and how this relates to the concept of "time", and of course, being
      philosophy the field that tackles science from an existential approach, the meaning of time and space,
      especially when it comes to an expanding universe, is discussed in several spaces dedicated to this
      branch as something still static, or even as something about which "perception has changed in recent
      years".
      <br>
      It is revealed that in spite of the popular knowledge on the subject, the cosmological constant is real
      and even a numerical value has been attributed to it, product of the investigations carried out during
      these last two decades.

      <br>
      There is no doubt at present, the cosmological constant exists and the universe is undoubtedly
      expanding. Einstein himself would probably have been surprised to learn that there was no mistake
      after all, and moreover, that it was certainly not the biggest of his life.
